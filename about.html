						<h3>Our Story</h3>
						<p>
                            Dose Insight was founded by an established team of physicists, engineers, and entrepreneurs. Throughout our decades working in medical device development, we have seen first-hand the risks posed by sterilization validation. By leveraging our proven expertise in developing high performance modeling software, we created Dose Insight to solve an unmet need in the medical device community.
                        </p>
